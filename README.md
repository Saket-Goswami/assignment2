# 🐍 Python Basics Programs

This repository contains two simple Python scripts demonstrating fundamental programming concepts — **conditional statements** and **loops**.  
These are ideal for beginners learning how Python handles logic and iteration.

## 🔢 Task 1: Even or Odd Checker (`task1.py`)

This script takes a number as input and checks whether it is **even** or **odd** using a simple conditional statement.

### 🧠 Concepts Used:
- User input using `input()`  
- Type conversion with `int()`  
- Conditional statements (`if-else`)  
- Formatted string output (`f-strings`)

### 💻 Example Run:
```
Enter a number: 8

8 is an even number.
```

---

## ➕ Task 2: Sum of Numbers (`task2.py`)

This program calculates the **sum of all numbers from 1 to 50** using a `for` loop and displays the result.

### 🧠 Concepts Used:
- Loops (`for` loop)  
- Variable initialization and accumulation  
- Formatted output using `f-strings`

### 💻 Example Run:
```
The sum of numbers from 1 to 50 is: 1275
```
